ServiceBusSimplifier

Small library that simplifies the most basic level of access to a Microsoft Windows Azure Service Bus Topic. If you've got a pub/sub situation in which you can represent each type of message as an individual object, this library can ease transition into an Azure Service Bus architecture. This library dynamically creates topics and subscriptions to those topics based on the type being used.

The [Kinectonitor ](http://bradygaster.com/the-kinectonitor) project makes use of the code that was the genesis for this project.
